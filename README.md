## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow.

Whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub checks out the repository
2. Installs dependencies
3. Runs automated tests
4. Builds Docker image

This demonstrates Continuous Integration.

If deployment steps are added, it becomes Continuous Deployment.
